# 🛠️ Two-Pass Assembler

A sleek, web-based demonstration of how a **Two-Pass Assembler** works under the hood. Ideal for students, educators, and systems programming enthusiasts, this project walks through how symbolic assembly code transforms into machine code using a step-by-step visual interface.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Forward references are a classic problem in assembly language. Our two-pass assembler **resolves them smartly**—first building a symbol table, then generating accurate machine code. This project turns a complex concept into an interactive, intuitive learning tool.

## ✨ Features

- **🎓 Learning-First Design** – Built for clear understanding of each assembler pass.
- **🌐 No Setup Required** – Just open it in your browser.
- **👁️ Visual Debugging** – Real-time display of intermediate files, symbol table, and output.
- **🧠 Intelligent Flow** – Separation of concerns across Pass 1 (analysis) and Pass 2 (code generation).

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS3 – For responsive, minimal UI  
- JavaScript – To simulate assembler logic entirely on the frontend  
- Vercel – Hosting for blazing-fast access

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔍 Pass 1: Analysis Phase
- Scans assembly source code
- Builds a **Symbol Table**
- Computes **Program Length**

### 🧾 Pass 2: Code Generation
- Resolves labels and symbols
- Generates **Object Code**
- Displays **Final Machine Instructions**
